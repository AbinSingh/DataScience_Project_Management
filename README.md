What is CRISP DM?
The CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) is a process model with six phases that naturally describes the data science life cycle. It’s like a set of guardrails to help you plan, organize, and implement your data science (or machine learning) project.

1.Business understanding – What does the business need?
2.Data understanding – What data do we have / need? Is it clean?
3.Data preparation – How do we organize the data for modeling?
4.Modeling – What modeling techniques should we apply?
5.Evaluation – Which model best meets the business objectives?
6.Deployment – How do stakeholders access the results?
